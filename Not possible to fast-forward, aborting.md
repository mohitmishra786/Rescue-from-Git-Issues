##### Error Message

```
 * branch            Base       -> FETCH_HEAD
fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
```

##### Solutions

The error message "Not possible to fast-forward, aborting" usually occurs when you are trying to merge two branches that have diverged and Git is unable to automatically determine how to merge them. Here are two possible solutions:

- Create a new merge commit: You can create a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches using the --no-ff option. This will create a new merge commit even if Git could perform a fast-forward merge. Here's the command you can use:
  - Replace Base with the name of the branch you want to merge.

```
git merge --no-ff Base

```

- Rebase your branch on top of the other branch: Another option is to rebase your branch on top of the other branch. This will apply your changes on top of the other branch, effectively replaying your commits on top of the other branch's commits. Here's the command you can use:
  - Replace Base with the name of the branch you want to rebase on.

```
git rebase Base
```

- Note that both of these solutions will modify the history of your branch, so use them with caution and make sure you understand the implications before proceeding.
